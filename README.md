# zooseeker-app
Coded Android App in a team of six people for CSE 110: Software Engineering course at UCSD. We Completed this project in two milestones, each being a month long. The outcome of our work was a Visit Planner app for the SD Zoo that utilizes GPS coordinates to redirect visitors toward the best path. We had to code in a fast solution to the TSP problem for this visit planner, which we did using dijsktra's algorithmn to form an approximate solution for the best TSP path from starting location.
